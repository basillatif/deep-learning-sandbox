# Deep Learning Algorithms - 2024

## Implementation of deep learning algorithms
#### List of Algorithms to Add (Prompt: What are the Top 3 Deep Learning Algorithms that can be added to a GitHub repository to study deep learning?)
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Use Case: Image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
Implementation:
Build a basic CNN for datasets like MNIST or CIFAR-10.
Extend it with techniques like transfer learning (e.g., using pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG).
Why: CNNs are foundational for understanding how deep learning processes spatial data.
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) / Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
Use Case: Sequence modeling such as time series forecasting, natural language processing (NLP), and speech recognition.
Implementation:
Implement basic RNNs to model sequential data.
Upgrade to LSTMs or GRUs for handling long-term dependencies.
Why: Studying these models is essential for understanding sequential data and temporal relationships.
3. Transformer Models
Use Case: NLP tasks like language translation, text summarization, and large-scale language modeling (e.g., GPT, BERT).
Implementation:
Implement a simple attention mechanism to understand the core idea.
Extend to a full transformer architecture for tasks like text classification.
Why: Transformers are the state-of-the-art models for many NLP tasks and provide insight into modern AI capabilities.
